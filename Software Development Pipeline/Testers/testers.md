## 🔗 **Code Combinations**

You can combine codes using `+` to chain multiple instructions:

* `test+auto:` → Test cases + automation
* `func+ui:` → Functional + UI tests
* `perf+load:` → Performance + load tests

## 📝 **Usage Examples**

* `test: User registration process` → Create test cases
* `func: E-commerce checkout flow` → Functional testing
* `perf: Database query performance` → Performance testing
