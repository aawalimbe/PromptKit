# PromptKit

A **new trend in prompting**: use a PromptKit to enhance your prompts, get consistent and better-quality responses, and cut down the number of tokens wasted as input.

PromptKit is a **shorthand prompt system** ‚Äî a set of codes you can use inside ChatGPT and other AI models to save time, improve consistency, and make prompting easier. Each code expands into a clear instruction for the AI. The best part? **It‚Äôs customizable.** You can adapt PromptKit to your personal workflow, your team, or your entire organization.

## üöÄ Why PromptKit?

Prompting today is messy:

* Writing full instructions every time wastes time and tokens.
* Templates help, but they‚Äôre rigid and don‚Äôt scale well.
* Non-technical users struggle with ‚ÄúMarkdown-like‚Äù prompt tricks.

**PromptKit solves this by giving you:**

* **Shorthand codes**: e.g., `cg:` = Correct grammar.
* **Consistency**: Every code always means the same thing.
* **Customization**: Add your own codes, department dictionaries, or personal shorthand.
* **Efficiency**: Faster prompting, fewer tokens.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** These codes are **input-only** - they expand into full instructions but are **not displayed** in the AI's response. Only the processed content appears in the output.

PromptKit is both a **system** (the rules for creating and using codes) and a **kit** (ready-to-use dictionaries for general users, students, and office departments).

## üõ† Setup and Installation

### With **ChatGPT**

1. Open **ChatGPT**.
2. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Personalization ‚Üí Custom Instructions**.
3. In the section that asks about instructions, paste the dictionary of codes you want to use. Example:

   ```
   cp: Correct the text professionally
   cg: Correct grammar
   sm: Summarize in bullet points
   ex: Expand details with examples
   qz: Create a quiz on the given topic
   int: Generate interview-style questions
   ```
4. Save. From now on, you can use shorthand anywhere in ChatGPT.

   * Example:

     ```
     cg: This sentence need fixing.
     ```

     ‚Üí Becomes *Correct grammar: This sentence need fixing.*

### With **Claude / Gemini / Other Models**

* If personalization exists: paste your codes in the settings.
* If not: paste your dictionary at the start of the chat as a system message.
* Then use the shorthand in your prompts normally.

### With **APIs or Local Models**

* Add the dictionary in the **system prompt**.
* Or preprocess your input with a simple script that expands codes into full instructions before sending them.

### **Troubleshooting**

**Codes not working?**
- Ensure codes end with `:` (colon)
- Check that your AI tool supports custom instructions
- Try restarting your AI session

**Codes showing in response?**
- This shouldn't happen - codes are input-only
- Check that you've properly set up custom instructions
- The AI should only show the processed content, not the codes

**Want to combine codes?**
- Use `+` to chain codes: `cp+sm: [text]`
- Order matters: `cp+sm` = correct professionally, then summarize

## üåç Why Open Source?

PromptKit was made open source to:

* Make prompting accessible to everyone, not just techies.
* Allow teams to build their own shared kits.
* Encourage experimentation and improvement.
* Build a **common language of prompting** that‚Äôs simple, flexible, and efficient.

Prompting should feel like second nature ‚Äî not a chore.
