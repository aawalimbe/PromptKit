## üîó **Code Combinations**

You can combine codes using `+` to chain multiple instructions:

* `ops.deploy+ops.ci:` ‚Üí Deployment + continuous integration
* `ops.mon+ops.log:` ‚Üí Monitoring + logging
* `ops.sec+ops.back:` ‚Üí Security + backup

## üìù **Usage Examples**

* `ops.deploy: Production release pipeline` ‚Üí Deployment automation
* `ops.mon: Application performance monitoring` ‚Üí Monitoring setup
* `ops.ci: Automated testing pipeline` ‚Üí Continuous integration
