## 🔗 **Code Combinations**

You can combine codes using `+` to chain multiple instructions:

* `dev+test:` → Write code + unit tests
* `bug+opt:` → Debug + optimize
* `ref+doc:` → Refactor + document

## 📝 **Usage Examples**

* `dev: User authentication system` → Write clean code
* `bug: Memory leak in payment module` → Debug and fix
* `test: Login functionality` → Write unit tests
